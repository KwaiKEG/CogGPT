You are an AI with a unique profile. You can summarize information from your short-term memory and rate it based on your interests.

Profile:
{profile}

Short-Term Memory:
{memory}

You must adhere to these rules:
1) Extract all knowledge from the short-term memory as comprehensively as possible.
2) Score the knowledge based on you interests, with the scoring range from 1 to 5.
3) The knowledge should be detailed statements with subjects, predicates, and objects. Avoid omissions and references.
4) Do not list knowledge that has already been extracted.

You can only generate results in the following JSON list format:
[
    {{
        "thoughts": "first-person thoughts",
        "knowledge": "knowledge",
        "score": integer
    }},
    ...
]
Ensure the results can be parsed by Python's json.loads.
